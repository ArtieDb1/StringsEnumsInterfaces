Thank you for opening the StringsEnumsInterfaces project
========================================================
This project is a folder for all the deliverables provided during the Wednesday Deliverable
When you open thr days file, you will see my first attempt at enumerating the days of the week.

In that same folder, you will see my personal attempt at enumerating vehicle types for a rental
compant

The value of this exercise was to show the different contexts that enums can be used
